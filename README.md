# Covariate Detection through Bandit Algorithms
This project aims to:

1. Derive an easy-to-implement contextual "bandit" algorithm which uses random forest as internal machinery to drive costly investigations in moral hazard contexts.
2. Illustrate the double public policy gains from this online learning algorithms compared to standard offline methods. The adoption of this sort of algorithms can increase participation by (i) reducing risk aversion losses for risk averse agents and (ii) increase per-subject monetary allocation without increasing the total expenditure of the policy.

### Ongoing project. Please don't take the material too seriously until later versions are uploaded ;)
